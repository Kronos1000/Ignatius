From now on extension requests are to be approved by myself.</p> \r\n<p>For those students are not contributing to group work, there will be consequences. If any students are caught doing more than there fair share to cover for someone else, this is not good enough. If someone in group is slack, please inform your tutor first and foremost. The tutor will speak with me and action will be taken accordingly.</p> \r\n<p>For those students who have already reached out and explained their situation to me, this does not affect you.</p> \r\n<p>I am fed up with some students who think it is okay to work long hours in turn they neglect their course work and commitment to the degree.</p> \r\n<p><strong>NB:</strong> All classes are onsite as from Monday. Occasionally a tutor may notify you of an online class instead.</p> \r\n<p>Thank you,</p> \r\n<p>Anita</p>",

This could be either proof of previous study in the area or related area, and/or enough knowledge, understanding and skill, which has been gained by doing personal learning.</p> \r\n<p>Please pass this message on to other students who you think want to enrol in Rachels papers, as some students STILL do not check their SIT email.</p> \r\n<p>Much appreciated,</p> \r\n<p>Anita</p> \r\n<p><br></p> \r\n<p><br></p> \r\n<p><br></p>",

Both Rachel and I will work through the list of student names and we will confirm acceptance with Julie in the Enrollments department. The other matter we will attend to will be addressing the capability of those students who are wanting to miss L5 and go straight to L6. Students who want to do this should have already spoken to me re what evidence they have to support this decision. This could be either proof of previous study in the area or related area, and/or enough knowledge, understanding and skill, which has been gained by doing personal learning.</p> \r\n<p>Please pass this message on to other students who you think want to enrol in Rachels papers, as some students STILL do not check their SIT email.</p> \r\n<p>Much appreciated,</p> \r\n<p>Anita</p> \r\n<p><br></p> \r\n<p><br></p> \r\n<p><br></p>",
